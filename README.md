# My communication projects

**Made by:** HongCheng Zhang. 

**What are these:** 
These are some images or movies that I've made since my undergraduate years. Some of them are posters or photographies, some of them are animated videos or edited videos. 
The applications used in making them are various: Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere, Touchdesigner, Unity etc.. 

**Future plans:**
When I get some free time to do my own stuffs, I'll try to make new animations or posters, and add them in here. 
A quick reminder to the future me: **"PLS DONT FORGET THESE SKILLS. YOU ONCE TOOK A LONG TIME AND HEAVY PASSION TO LEARN THEM. PLS CHERISH YOUR PAST AND MAKE BETTER PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE. I TRUST YOU, AS ALWAYS."**
