# My communication projects

**Made by:** HongCheng Zhang. 

**What are these:** 
I've made these images or movies since my undergraduate years. Some of them are posters or photographs, some of them are animated videos or edited videos. <br>
The applications used in making them are various: Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere, Touchdesigner, Unity, etc.. 

**Future plans:**
When I get some free time to do my stuff, I'll try to make new animations or posters, and add them here. <br>
A quick reminder to the future me: **"PLS DONT FORGET THESE SKILLS. YOU ONCE TOOK A LONG TIME AND HEAVY PASSION TO LEARN THEM. PLS CHERISH YOUR PAST AND MAKE BETTER PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE. I TRUST YOU, AS ALWAYS."**
